# Magistrates of the Roman Republic

It is my belief that both of the initial volumes of *Magistrates of the Roman Republic* are in the public domain. They were published prior to 1964. Even though copyright was asserted at the time of their publication, that copyright was not renewed within 28 years of publication. See for details:

* https://fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/public-domain/welcome/

The second volume of _Magistrates of the Roman Republic_ has a [post-1980 entry on Copyright.gov](https://publicrecords.copyright.gov/detailed-record/13862961). However, the basis for the claim is _only_ to the new introduction. Moreover, because this was registered _after_ the original work published in 1952 already fell into the public domain, it cannot revive any such copyright.
